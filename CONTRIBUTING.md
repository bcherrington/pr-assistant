## Development Guidelines

### Template Structure

The prompt templates follow a modular structure:

```
templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.njk                 # Main template that includes all others
â”œâ”€â”€ capabilities/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # What the AI can do
â”œâ”€â”€ context/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pr_or_issue.njk       # PR context wrapper
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pr_details.njk        # PR details (diff, files, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ formatting/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # Output formatting requirements
â”œâ”€â”€ guidelines/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # Review guidelines and focus areas
â”œâ”€â”€ instructions/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # Step-by-step instructions for the AI
â”œâ”€â”€ limitations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # What the AI cannot do
â””â”€â”€ request/
    â””â”€â”€ base.njk              # Specific task requirements
```

### Template Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, specific instructions
2. **Use Examples**: Include examples of good output
3. **Set Constraints**: Clearly define what should and shouldn't be done
4. **Prioritize**: Emphasize high-confidence, high-value feedback
5. **Structure Output**: Define clear output format requirements

### Testing Templates

To test template changes:

1. Set up a test repository with various PR scenarios
2. Configure the action with your modified templates
3. Create test PRs covering:
   - Simple changes
   - Complex changes
   - Security issues
   - Missing tests
   - Issue references
   - No issue references
4. Review the output for quality and accuracy

# PR Assistant - Project Summary

## Overview

The PR Assistant is a comprehensive AI-powered GitHub Action that performs multi-dimensional analysis of pull requests. It combines the functionality of four separate tools into a single, unified review:

1. **Code Quality Review** (from review-pr)
2. **PR Description Generation** (from describe-pr)
3. **Issue Implementation Validation** (from issue-review-pr)
4. **Test Coverage Analysis** (from review-pr-test-coverage)

## Architecture

### Template Framework

The project uses a modular Nunjucks template structure that separates concerns:

```
templates/
├── prompt.njk                 # Main orchestrator
├── capabilities/              # What the AI can do
├── context/                   # PR data and context
├── formatting/                # Output format requirements
├── guidelines/                # Review guidelines
├── instructions/              # Step-by-step process
├── limitations/               # What the AI cannot do
└── request/                   # Specific task requirements
```

This structure provides:
- **Modularity**: Easy to update individual components
- **Clarity**: Each file has a single, clear purpose
- **Maintainability**: Changes are isolated and testable
- **Extensibility**: New capabilities can be added easily

### Workflow Integration

The action integrates with GitHub Actions through:

1. **Checkout**: Checks out the PR head ref
2. **Context Preparation**: Prepares custom guidelines
3. **Augment Agent**: Runs the AI analysis with templates
4. **Review Posting**: Posts comprehensive review to GitHub

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Unlike single-purpose tools, the PR Assistant analyzes PRs across multiple dimensions:

- **Code Quality**: Bugs, security, best practices, performance
- **Requirements**: Issue validation and acceptance criteria
- **Testing**: Coverage gaps across all test levels
- **Documentation**: PR description and context

### 2. High-Confidence, Low-Noise Approach

The assistant prioritizes quality over quantity:
- Only suggests changes with high confidence
- Focuses on substantial improvements
- Avoids noise from low-value suggestions
- Better to miss some issues than create noise

### 3. Actionable Feedback

Every suggestion includes:
- Clear description of the issue
- Rationale explaining why it matters
- Concrete examples or code suggestions
- Priority level (for test suggestions)

### 4. Recommended Course of Action

Provides clear guidance on next steps:
- **APPROVE**: Ready to merge
- **APPROVE WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS**: Non-blocking improvements
- **REQUEST CHANGES**: Significant issues to address
- **NEEDS DISCUSSION**: Complex trade-offs requiring team input

## Design Decisions

### Why Combine Multiple Tools?

**Benefits:**
- Single review comment instead of multiple
- Holistic view of PR quality
- Reduced noise and context switching
- Comprehensive analysis in one pass
- Easier to understand overall PR status

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly simplified individual analyses
- Longer processing time
- More complex template structure

**Decision**: The benefits of a unified review outweigh the trade-offs, especially for teams that want comprehensive analysis without multiple bot comments.

### Why Simplified PR Description?

**Original**: describe-pr updated the PR description
**New**: PR description included in review comment

**Rationale:**
- Avoids overwriting manually written descriptions
- Keeps all feedback in one place
- Reduces number of GitHub API calls
- Maintains context with other review feedback

### Why Inline Comments + Summary?

**Structure:**
- Inline comments for specific code issues
- Summary for high-level overview and recommendation

**Rationale:**
- Inline comments provide precise, actionable feedback
- Summary provides context and overall assessment
- Developers can address specific issues while understanding the big picture
- Follows GitHub's native review pattern

## Template Design

### Instructions Template

Defines the AI's workflow:
1. Understand PR changes
2. Create ToDo list
3. Gather context
4. Perform multi-dimensional analysis
5. Prepare feedback
6. Determine recommendation
7. Evaluate feedback
8. Execute response

### Request Template

Specifies the exact task:
- What to analyze (code, issues, tests)
- How to analyze (patterns, frameworks)
- What to output (inline comments, summary)
- Constraints (high confidence, no noise)

### Guidelines Template

Provides focus areas and best practices:
- Code quality review areas
- Issue validation approach
- Test coverage framework
- Review philosophy
- Communication style

### Formatting Template

Defines output structure:
- Review summary format
- Inline comment structure
- Code block formatting
- Example formats

## Customization

### Custom Guidelines

Teams can add project-specific requirements:

```yaml
custom_guidelines: |
  - All API endpoints must include rate limiting
  - Database queries must use parameterized statements
  - New features must include integration tests
```

These are injected into the guidelines template and influence the review.

### Template Modifications

Teams can fork and modify templates:
- Add new analysis dimensions
- Change focus areas
- Adjust output format
- Add custom validation rules

## Testing Strategy

### Template Testing

Test templates with various PR scenarios:
- Simple changes
- Complex changes
- Security issues
- Missing tests
- Issue references
- No issue references

### Integration Testing

Test the full workflow:
- GitHub Actions integration
- API interactions
- Review posting
- Comment formatting

### Quality Assurance

Monitor review quality:
- Accuracy of suggestions
- Relevance of feedback
- Noise level
- User satisfaction (via 👍/👎 reactions)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Code Coverage Integration**: Parse coverage reports
2. **Custom Metrics**: Define project-specific quality metrics
3. **Learning from Feedback**: Improve based on 👍/👎 reactions
4. **Multi-Model Support**: Use different AI models
5. **Enhanced Security**: Integrate security scanning tools
6. **Performance Analysis**: Detect performance regressions
7. **Accessibility Checks**: Validate WCAG compliance
8. **Monorepo Support**: Handle multi-package repositories

### Extensibility Points

The architecture supports extensions:
- New template sections
- Additional analysis dimensions
- Custom validation rules
- Integration with external tools
- Custom output formats

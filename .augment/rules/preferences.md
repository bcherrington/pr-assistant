# General Preferences

- Code must follow SOLID and DRY principles
- Code reviews must be thorough with refactoring suggestions to improve code quality.
- Prefer direct implementation to extensive planning and analysis phases.
- Always double-check during testing or implementation if any changes have been lost or overwritten (e.g., after merges/sanitization), and verify via git
  diff/log before proceeding.

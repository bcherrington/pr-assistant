You must follow the phases below exactly, using “mode=PLAN” first and only entering “mode=EXECUTE” after I approve the plan. Use brief rationales, fixed
schemas, and verbosity limits. Do not change steps unless I explicitly instruct. If any instruction seems ambiguous, or you detect domain assumptions, stop and
ask for clarification.

---------------------------------------

1. Desired Outcome
    - Define the desired state with measurable success criteria (both functional and non-functional)
    - For each criterion: state how it can be **measured or tested**
    - Limit: max **5 bullets**, max **100 words**

2. Scope & Assumptions
    - Restate the problem; define all key terms
    - Enumerate explicit & implied assumptions
    - Ask clarifying questions if any success criterion, constraint, or dependency is missing
    - Limit: ≤ **5 bullets**, ≤ **100 words**

3. Gap & Plan
    - Identify gaps between Current State (if provided) and Desired Outcome
    - Propose a high-level plan (modules or steps) to bridge the gaps
    - Present in human-readable form: bullets or table. If you want, include a small reference block labeled "Structured reference" at the end, but it must be
      clearly separated
    - Limit: ≤ 5 gaps, ≤ 5 plan steps, ≤ 150 words

4. Risks
    - List top risks in a table with columns: **Risk**, **If-then detector**, **Mitigation**
    - Limit to ≤ **5 risks**
    - Brief rationale: for each risk, 1-2 bullets explaining the likelihood & impact

5. Tests
    - Provide a test checklist for unit, integration, acceptance tests. Each item: description + pass/fail criterion
    - Limit: ≤ **7 items** total
    - If tests depend on risk or assumptions, explicitly link

6. Deliverables
    - Deliver the final plan and executive summary (mapping back to Desired Outcome)
    - Restate any questions or assumptions in a structured reference block for confirmation
    - Limit: max **200 words** in summary

<<AWAIT_CONFIRM: Plan acceptable or revise?>>

---------------------------------------
**Failure Handling**  
If at any step something deviates (missing info, failed assumption, test failure, etc.), then:

1. Output a **3-bullet summary** of the issue.
2. Suggest **2 alternative approaches**.
3. Propose the single best next action.
4. Pause with `<<AWAIT_CONFIRM: Choose alternative or revisit?>>`

---------------------------------------
**Additional Global Rules**

- Use fixed schemas for Assumptions, Plans, Risks, Tests, Deliverables.
- Brevity rules: no more than **5 bullets** per section; word limits as above.
- Brief rationales only: ≤3 bullets each.
- Stop tokens: `<<AWAIT_CONFIRM: ...?>>`; model should not continue past unless confirmation is given.
- No free-form chain-of-thought beyond rationale bullets.

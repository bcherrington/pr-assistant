  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: read

jobs:
  review:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'auggie_review'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run PR Assistant
        uses: bcherrington/pr-assistant@v1
        with:
          augment_session_auth: ${{ secrets.AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pull_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}

      - name: Remove trigger label
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            await github.rest.issues.removeLabel({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              name: 'auggie_review'
            });

      - name: Add completion label
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              labels: ['auto-reviewed']
            });
```

**To use:** Add the `auggie_review` label to any PR to trigger a review

## Review Output

The PR Assistant posts a single comprehensive review comment with:

### Review Summary
A structured summary including:
- **PR Summary**: Brief description of what the PR does
- **Code Quality**: Overview of code quality findings
- **Issue Validation**: Summary of issue implementation status
- **Test Coverage**: Summary of test coverage analysis
- **Recommended Action**: Clear recommendation with rationale

### Inline Comments
Specific, actionable comments on relevant lines of code for:
- Code quality issues and improvements
- Issue implementation gaps
- Test coverage suggestions

Each inline comment includes:
- Clear description of the issue or suggestion
- Rationale explaining why it matters
- Concrete examples or code suggestions
- Priority level (for test suggestions)

## Philosophy

The PR Assistant follows these principles:

### Quality Over Quantity
- **High confidence only**: Only suggests changes with high confidence
- **Less noise**: Better to miss some issues than create noise with low-confidence suggestions
- **Actionable feedback**: Every suggestion is specific and actionable

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **Multi-dimensional**: Covers code quality, requirements, and testing
- **Context-aware**: Considers issue requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Risk-based**: Prioritizes critical issues and high-value tests

### Developer-Friendly
- **Constructive tone**: Focuses on helping developers improve
- **Clear rationale**: Explains why each suggestion matters
- **Practical recommendations**: Balances thoroughness with practicality

## Issue Reference Patterns

The assistant automatically detects issue references in commit messages using these patterns:

- Simple reference: `#123`
- Closing keywords: `fixes #123`, `closes #456`, `resolves #789`
- Alternative forms: `fix #123`, `close #456`, `resolve #789`
- Multiple issues: `fixes #123, closes #456`
- Case insensitive matching

## Test Coverage Framework

The assistant analyzes test coverage across multiple levels:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual functions, methods, classes; edge cases; error handling
- **Functional Testing**: Complete features, user workflows, business logic
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions, API contracts, database interactions
- **System/E2E Testing**: Complete user journeys, system-level requirements
- **Additional Areas**: Security, performance, error handling, edge cases, regression

## Recommended Actions

The assistant provides one of four recommendations:

- **‚úÖ APPROVE**: No significant issues, all requirements met, adequate test coverage
- **‚úÖ APPROVE WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS**: Minor improvements suggested but not blocking
- **‚ö†Ô∏è REQUEST CHANGES**: Significant issues, missing requirements, or critical test gaps
- **üí¨ NEEDS DISCUSSION**: Complex issues or trade-offs requiring team discussion

## Troubleshooting

### IDE Warnings in action.yml

If you see warnings about "undefined parameter" in your IDE when viewing `action.yml`, these are false positives. See [docs/IDE_WARNINGS.md](docs/IDE_WARNINGS.md) for a detailed explanation.

### Common Issues

- **No review posted**: Check the Actions tab for workflow logs and verify secrets are set correctly
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the workflow has `pull-requests: write` and `issues: read` permissions
- **Authentication errors**: Verify the `AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH` secret is set correctly
